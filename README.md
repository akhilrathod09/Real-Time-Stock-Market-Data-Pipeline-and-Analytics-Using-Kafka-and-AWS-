# Real-Time Stock Market Data Pipeline and Analytics Using Kafka and AWS - Data Engineering Project

## Description
Built a Python application to simulate real-time stock market data, publishing events to an Apache Kafka broker hosted on
an AWS EC2 instance.Designed a producer-consumer model to ingest, process, and store data efficiently.
Streamed events into Amazon S3 and automated schema inference using AWS Glue Crawler to build a Glue Data Catalog,
enabling seamless querying and data exploration.
Utilized Amazon Athena for SQL-based analytics on stock market data, demonstrating real-time data insights and building
a scalable, end-to-end data pipeline for event streaming, storage, and analysis
